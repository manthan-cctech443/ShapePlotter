ShapePlotter
Project Overview
ShapePlotter is a C++ application that allows users to create and visualize various geometric shapes, including lines, triangles, rectangles, squares, circles, polygons, regular polygons, and stars. The application facilitates user input for shape parameters and generates corresponding points, which can be saved to files for further analysis or visualization.

Features
Create and save multiple shapes: Rectangle, Square, Circle, Triangle, Polygon, Line, Regular Polygon, and Star.
Input shape dimensions and vertices through a user-friendly console interface.
Output shape data to separate files in the .dat format.
Display the vertices of each shape in the console.
Requirements
C++11 or later
A compatible C++ compiler (e.g., g++, Visual Studio)
Basic understanding of C++ programming

Run the executable. You will be presented with a menu to choose a shape:

Choose a shape to create and save:
1. Rectangle
2. Square
3. Circle
4. Triangle
5. Polygon
6. Line
7. Regular Polygon
8. Star
Enter the corresponding number to select a shape.

Follow the prompts to enter the necessary parameters for the selected shape.

After inputting the parameters, the program will display the vertices of the shape and save the shape data to a .dat file in the DAT directory.

Check the DAT directory for the saved files containing the shape data.

Example
To create a rectangle, select option 1, input the bottom-left and top-right points, and the program will generate and save the rectangle's vertices to rectangle.dat.
